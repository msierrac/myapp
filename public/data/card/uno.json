  "history": "The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robbins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois.\r\nIn 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.",
  "rules": {
    "play": "The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, achieved (usually over several rounds of play) by being the first to play all of one's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players. \r\nThe deck consists of 108 cards: four each of \"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four,\" and 25 each of four different colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of \"Skip,\" \"Draw Two,\" and \"Reverse.\" These last three types are known as \"action cards.\" To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, they must do one of the following: play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol, play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card, draw the top card from the deck, then play it if possible. Cards are played by laying them face-up on top of the discard pile. Play proceeds clockwise around the table. \n A player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn.\nA player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other playable cards.\nA player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card. A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence (see Penalties) to prove that their hand meets this condition.\nIf the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds normally.\nIt is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player.\nA player who plays their next-to-last-card must call \"Uno\" as a warning to the other players. \r\nThe first player to get rid of their last card (\"going out\") wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players. Number cards count their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied.\r\nThe first player to score 500 points wins the game.",
    "penalties": ["If a player does not call \"Uno\" after laying down their next-to-last card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn (i.e., plays a card from their hand, draws from the deck, or touches the discard pile), they must draw two cards as a penalty. If the player is not caught in time (subject to interpretation) or remembers to call \"Uno\" before being caught, they suffer no penalty.", "If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card, the following player can challenge its use. The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately show their hand to the challenging player, in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards. If the challenge is correct, then the challenged player draws four cards instead. If the challenge is wrong, then the challenger must draw six cards; the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards."],
    "twoplayer": "In a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like a Skip card; when played, the other player misses a turn.\r\n"
  },
  "strategies": "A strategy at Uno may be offensive (aiming to go out), or defensive (aiming to minimize the value of one's hand, in the event that another player goes out, thus getting those points). Part of the skill of playing Uno is knowing when to adopt an offensive or defensive strategy.\r\nAn offensive strategy would be holding on to Wild and Wild Draw Four cards because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out (when it's harder to play a matching card). However, a defensive strategy would advise getting rid of such cards early, because they have a high point value.\r\nA defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand. However, an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color, because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color (there is only one 0 of each color, but two of each 1â€“9).\r\nA player holding only one card is required to call out \"Uno\" or risk being penalized if caught. A player who calls \"Uno\" risks being the target of concerted action by the other players, who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out. Depending on the level and seriousness of play, some players may deliberately avoid saying \"Uno\", in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn. For this reason, it is useful to conceal how many cards are in one's own hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds.\r\nLittle has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of Uno. Simulations of games may shed some light on the matter. Attempts to reduce point count in a player's hands can be \"read\" by other players if too transparent. This information can be exploited by other players, and it follows that a mixed strategy may be more appropriate.",
